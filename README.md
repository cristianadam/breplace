Small command line utility that replaces a binary file in a binary file.

When ran without parameters it prints:

```
$ breplace.exe
usage: breplace <file_container> <file_to_be_replaced> <file_to_replace> <dest_file_container>
```

This utility was used in the [Lenovo Fn-Ctrl Swap](http://cristianadam.blogspot.com/2015/01/lenovo-fn-ctrl-swap.html) blog entry.
